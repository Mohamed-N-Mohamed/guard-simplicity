        I just wanted to take a few minutes to recognise the work and dedication
        you and your team have provided in this challenging time. I know this is
        an ever-changing environment with new ways of working day by day and
        Boots is as ever a demanding customer. It was good to hear that Guard
        Simplicity as a partner was mentioned with the outstanding work you have
        provided and continue to provide. I know some locations and requests
        have been complex, however, your team and your security guards have
        delivered to an excellent standard. Itâ€™s also good to see the feedback
        coming from customers who have had a great experience too.
